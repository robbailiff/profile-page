                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I have been working as a Geoscientist for over 13 years and I have used Python scripts for a long time and never knew how they worked or how to code. 
                        When looking for a new skill to learn, I came across Python and realised that I really enjoy the problem solving side of programming 
                        and that learning it has a tangible benefit in my day to day working, as well as an application to many Geoscience problems. Since then I have been actively self-learning 
                        programming languages and tools in my spare time for the last few years to improve my effectiveness at my job, but also add skills which could allow me to transition 
                        to another career.</p>
                    <p> I have seen a gradual move away from the use and production of “old school” paper maps to fully digital workflows using software such as ArcGIS. 
                        I can only see this trend continuing in the future and this is ultimately what has led me to want to learn more about programming and improve my digital skills. 
                        Areas that are especially of interest to me are web/software development, automation of manual processes, and the application of Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to Geoscience problems.</p>
                    <p> During my time working as a Geoscientist, my focus has been mostly on research and mapping of palaeogeology and palaeogeography. 
                        Most of the projects I have worked on have been multidisciplinary, involving big teams, large datasets and with a regional to global focus. 
                        In particular, I have spent a lot of time working on North America and enjoy the balance of the quantity and quality of available data in conjunction 
                        with challenging geological problems to solve in this region.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I spend most of my time entertaining my young family, and use most of my spare time for learning and self improvement. 
                        I have a keen interest in wildlife and the natural world, and combine this with a love of walking and hiking the outdoors. 
                        I also have a love for homebrewing beer, and I am an avid fan of football, cricket and ice hockey.</p>

                        <p>This project was created in Javascript to practice control flow, loops and DOM interaction. The game allows the user to make their choice via clicking a button, 
                            generates a random choice for the computer player, displays the running score, and announces the winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.</p>

                        <p>This is a browser based Etch-A-Sketch application which works by creating a grid of squares, which change colour when a mouse passes over them to effectively draw an image. 
                            It allows the user to choose different colours to draw with, as well as the grid size and the ability to clear the current sketch.</p>

                        <p>This is a score keeper widget for a game of ping pong built using the Bulma CSS framework. It allows the user to set the number of wins required, use buttons to increase the wins for a player, 
                            indicate when one player has won the required number of games and then change the score colours and disable the buttons, and then finally a buttom to reset the scores.</p>
