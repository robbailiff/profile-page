                <p>I have used Python scripts in my day job as a Geoscientist for a long time and never knew how they worked or how to code. 
                    When looking for a new skill to learn, I came across Python and realised that I really enjoy the problem solving side of programming and that learning 
                    it has a tangible benefit in my day to day working, as well as an application to many Geoscience problems.</p>
                <p>I was inspired to setup up this website as somewhere to be able to showcase some of the projects I have completed and to blog about things I have learnt. 
                    It helps me cement the knowledge I have gained but I also hope that it may be of help to someone else.</p>

                    <p>I have been working as a Geoscientist for over 13 years with my focus mostly on research and mapping of palaeogeology and palaeogeography. 
                        Most of the projects I have worked on have been multidisciplinary, involving big teams, large datasets and with a regional to global focus. 
                        In particular, I have spent a lot of time working on North America and enjoy the balance of the quantity and quality of available data in conjunction 
                        with challenging geological problems to solve in this region.</p>
                    <p>During my time working in these fields I have seen a gradual move away from the use and production of “old school” paper maps to fully digital workflows 
                        using software such as ArcGIS. I can only see this trend continuing in the future and this is ultimately what has led me to want to learn Python programming. 
                        The automation of many manual processes and the application of Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to Geoscience data are areas that especially interest me.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, I spend most of my time entertaining my young family, and use most of my spare time for learning and self improvement. 
                        I have a keen interest in wildlife and the natural world, and combine this with a love of walking and hiking the outdoors. 
                        I also have a love for homebrewing beer, and I am an avid fan of football, cricket and ice hockey.</p>
